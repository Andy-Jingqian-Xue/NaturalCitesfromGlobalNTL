# NaturalCites-GlobalNTL
This tutorial delivers step-by-step guidance on recursively identifying natural cities using nighttime light data, those are the brightest areas indicative of high human activity levels. It leverages global nighttime imagery to analyze spatial-temporal dynamics qualitatively and quantitatively from 1992 to the present. The tutorial begins by defining natural cities and outlining the recursive generation process. After that, it delves into the inherent order or livingness of natural cities, including methods for their calculation. Finally, the tutorial concludes with an interpretation of the findings and a discussion on their broader implications.
