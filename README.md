# Delineating Natural Cities around the World and Mapping their Spatial-Temporal Dynamics from Nighttime Imagery Using a Recursive Approach
This tutorial delivers a step-by-step tutorial on recursively identifying natural cities using Nighttime Light (NTL) data, those are the brightest areas indicative of high human activity levels. It leverages global nighttime imagery to analyze spatial-temporal dynamics of the complexity of urban systems both qualitatively and quantitatively during the recent two decades. The tutorial begins by introducing natural cities and outlining the recursive generation process. After that, it delves into the complexity of natural cities, including methods for their calculation. Finally, the tutorial concludes with an interpretation of the findings and a discussion on their broader implications.
